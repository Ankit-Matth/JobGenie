# 💼 Job Genie – Unified Job Search Platform

**Job Genie** is a centralized job search platform built to streamline and automate the job discovery process across multiple websites like **Naukri.com**, **Indeed**, and **Internshala**. It is a final year BTech major project aimed at solving the real-world inefficiencies job seekers face by providing an all-in-one solution.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

### Problem 1:
 The lack of a centralized platform to streamline job searches across multiple websites, such as Naukri.com, Indeed, and Internshala, leads to significant challenges for job seekers. Manually navigating and monitoring these platforms for new job postings is overwhelming, time-consuming, and inefficient. This fragmentation reduces productivity and creates a barrier to staying updated with the latest opportunities

### Problem 2:
 Job seekers struggle with setting up custom filters or receiving timely notifications for job postings tailored to their preferences. Existing solutions require users to repeatedly visit platforms, apply search criteria manually, and track postings themselves. This repetitive process results in missed opportunities, frustration, and inefficient job application management.
